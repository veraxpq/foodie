    "text": "Overall the dining experience itself was decent. They socially distanced the tables and put sauces, side dishes, fruits... anything that you can find at the bar, into individual plastic containers. This made sure that the food inside is not contaminated. We saw our waitress one more time during the entire visit. She was busy catering to another table, asking them if they needed anything else, in Mandarin. But when she passed our table we received no attention whatsoever. There is definitely some preference from this waitress specifically to cater to those who spoke Mandarin.  I guess if I had known that I would have spoken to her in Mandarin as soon as we entered the restaurant. In total we spent $189 for two people. I think it's a hefty price for the experience and the food. I would recommend going elsewhere to spend your money. In fact, I remember telling my friend that we got more service at Boiling Point than we did here, and BP tastes even better.",
